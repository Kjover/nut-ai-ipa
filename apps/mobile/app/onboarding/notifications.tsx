/**
 * Reminders.
 *
 * The system permission prompt is deliberately NOT requested here. Local
 * reminders are an M5 feature, and asking for a permission the app cannot yet
 * use is how apps train people to hit "Don't Allow" — you get one prompt, and
 * spending it before there is anything to deliver wastes it.
 *
 * Whether reminders default ON is already decided by the blocker answer
 * (featureDefaultsFor), so this screen is explanation, not another question.

          one is local to your device. Nothing is scheduled on a server, because there is no server.

        not now. You can turn them on or off any time in Settings.
